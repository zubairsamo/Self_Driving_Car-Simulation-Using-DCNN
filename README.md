# Description
![alt text](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iutOIJt1zVM/maxresdefault.jpg)
In this repository i actually implement self driving car simulation script using deep convolutional neural networks and its gives me better result just clone it and train your car also you can use my model which is already in this repository 
# Steps:
1:Download all requirments

2: Train your car which is preety much handy if you read udacity own description of how to record and save driving log 

3: Clone this project and just train your model with your training data 

4: After successfully done all related stuff which is in drive.py file you can run you car with autonomous mode 

 Enjoy!

## Requirements

Type below command in cmd to get up and running with the dependencies of the file.
```
pip install -r requirement.txt
```
 git clone https://github.com/zubairsamo/Self_Driving_Car-Simulation-Using-DCNN
.git

## Usage
Firstly You Have to Download Udacity simulator from here https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim 
drive.py
